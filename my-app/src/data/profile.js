    bio: [
        "I'm Alejandro, a character 3D animator from Barcelona. I love challenges, developing a shot and emboding characters to make a performance feel real and alive.",
        "I've animated for Passion Pictures on a Fall Guys Demo, and Framestore London on the upcoming feature film \"The Sheep Detectives\". And before that, I spent two years at the studio Lumatic VFX animating on Die Schule der magischen Tiere 3 and 4. In all these experiences I've built pipeline tools that speed up the workflow of the animation team.",
        "I hit deadlines, keep quality high, support my colleagues, and always bring joy to every shot."
